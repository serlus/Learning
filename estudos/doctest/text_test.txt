The fib(N) function takes a single integer as its only
parameter N. If N is 0 or 1, the function returns 1. If
N is less than 0, the function raises a ValueError.
Otherwise, the function returns the sum of fib(N - 1)
and fib(N - 2). The returned value will never be less
than 1. On versions of Python older than 2.2. and if 
N is at least 52, the function will raise an OverflowError.
A naive implementation of this function would get very
slow as N increased.

exemple:
>>> from estudos.doctest.fib import fib
>>> fib(0)
1
>>> fib(1)
1
>>> fib(-1)
raise ValueError
>>> fib(2)
1
